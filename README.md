# ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE ⚠️

The Wafer Café has been blocked (locally) by my school district (HCSD). I will not be able to work on the website until I register and purchase a new domain. I plan to use https://wafercafe.site/ from now on, and I will update you all hopefully soon.

# The Wafer Café

A user-friendly web assembly video game website, aimed to entertain users (during work and school, too!).

## About

The Wafer Café strives to have fun games in the browser, entertaining our users. Most games use Web Assembly to run, and some are made with JavaScript.

'Features'
- Simple GUI
- Silly particle background
- Light/dark mode

## Info

Please star if you fork, or simply find this useful!

While the Wafer Café is intended to be be a game center, I also ocasionally run my school projects on this domain.

## Self-Hosting Wafer Café

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to download the project:

   `git clone https://github.com/MajesticWafer/wafercafe`

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

2. After cloning, move into the new directory by running:

   `cd wafercafe`

### Step 3: Expose Your Local Port

3. Use **ngrok** to expose your port and access the project externally:

   `ngrok http <port>`

   Replace `<port>` with any available port number not being used by another application.

   **Note**: If you don't have ngrok installed, [here's a guide to install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Step 4: Access Your Link

4. Once you run the ngrok command, you'll receive a unique link. Copy and paste this link into your browser, or manually enter it on any device to access your local setup.
